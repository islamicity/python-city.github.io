# how to start quick the python project and the standart folder of it ?

Starting a Python project involves creating a directory structure and organizing your code in a way that makes it easy to maintain and scale. A common standard folder structure for a Python project is as follows:

## code
project_name/
    |
    |--- docs/
    |--- project_name/
    |      |--- __init__.py
    |      |--- main.py
    |      |--- module1.py
    |      |--- module2.py
    |      |--- ...
    |
    |--- tests/
    |      |--- test_module1.py
    |      |--- test_module2.py
    |      |--- ...
    |
    |--- setup.py
    |--- README.md
    |--- .gitignore
    
Here's a brief explanation of each component:

project_name/: This is the root directory of your project, which should be named after your project.

docs/: This directory contains documentation related to your project, such as API documentation, user guides, or technical specifications.

project_name/: This directory contains the source code of your project. The name of this directory should match the name of the root directory.

__init__.py: This file is used to define the behavior of the directory as a Python package. It is usually an empty file, but it can be used to perform initialization tasks for your project.

main.py: This file contains the main entry point for your project, which is the starting point when the project is executed.

module1.py, module2.py, etc.: These files contain the functions and classes that make up the core functionality of your project.

tests/: This directory contains the tests for your project, which should be organized into separate files for each module or component.

setup.py: This file is used to define the metadata of your project and set up the installation process.

README.md: This file contains a brief description of your project and information on how to get started with it.

.gitignore: This file is used to specify files and directories that should not be tracked by Git, such as temporary files or secret keys.

This is a standard folder structure for a Python project, but you can modify it to suit your specific needs. The important thing is to be consistent and organize your code in a way that makes sense for your project.
